My legal partner Lawyer Name</a> has been along from the very beginning.</p><p>As an investor, I see many term sheets. Quite often, they are written with primarily the interests of the investors or the founders in mind. This is not the best starting point for a successful relationship! Why not start negotiations based on a fair and balanced term sheet instead? I'm convinced that this approach long-term will benefit both the company and all shareholders.</p><p>In addition to the investment documents (term sheet, subscription agreement and shareholder's agreement), I have also created a guide to stock options in startups.</p><p>It's all free – this is my way of giving back to the startup community. You are free to use, modify and share the documents, but you may not commercially exploit them.</p></p></div></section></div><div class="section document-templates"><section><div class=content><h2>Documents</h2><ul><li><h3><a title="Term Sheet" href=term-sheet>Term Sheet</a></h3><p>Balanced and standardized, for seed round.
