      h2: What is StartupDocs?
      text: "<p>I, <a href='https://twitter.com/#'>User Name</a>, took this initiative to help entrepreneurs focus on running their businesses, instead of spending time and money on unnecessary legal paperwork and tiresome negotiations. My legal partner Lawyer Name</a> has been along from the very beginning.</p><p>As an investor, I see many term sheets. Quite often, they are written with primarily the interests of the investors or the founders in mind. This is not the best starting point for a successful relationship! Why not start negotiations based on a fair and balanced term sheet instead? I'm convinced that this approach long-term will benefit both the company and all shareholders.</p><p>In addition to the investment documents (term sheet, subscription agreement and shareholder's agreement), I have also created a guide to stock options in startups.</p><p>It's all free – this is my way of giving back to the startup community. You are free to use, modify and share the documents, but you may not commercially exploit them.</p>"
